# React Hooks Explained: A Comprehensive Guide

![React Hooks](https://picsum.photos/seed/react-hooks/800/400)

React Hooks have revolutionized the way we write React components. In this post, we'll explore the most commonly used hooks and how they can make your code more readable and efficient.

## useState

The useState hook is used for adding state to functional components. Here's a simple example:

\`\`\`jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
\`\`\`

This creates a state variable `count` and a function `setCount` to update it. The initial value is 0.

## useEffect

useEffect is used for side effects in functional components. It's similar to componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.

\`\`\`jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
\`\`\`

## useContext

useContext is used for consuming context in functional components. It's a simpler alternative to the Context.Consumer component.

\`\`\`jsx
const value = useContext(MyContext);
\`\`\`

## useRef

useRef is perfect for keeping a mutable value around without causing re-renders when it's changed.

\`\`\`jsx
const inputRef = useRef(null);
\`\`\`

## useMemo

useMemo is used for memoizing expensive computations. It only recomputes the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed.

\`\`\`jsx
const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]);
\`\`\`

## useCallback

useCallback is similar to useMemo, but it returns a memoized callback instead of a memoized value.

\`\`\`jsx
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
);
\`\`\`

## Custom Hooks

One of the best features of hooks is that you can create your own custom hooks to reuse stateful logic between different components.

\`\`\`jsx
function useWindowWidth() {
  const [width, setWidth] = useState(window.innerWidth);
  
  useEffect(() => {
    const handleResize = () => setWidth(window.innerWidth);
    window.addEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    return () => {
      window.removeEventListener('resize', handleResize);
    };
  }, []);

  return width;
}
\`\`\`

## Conclusion

React Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know. They allow you to organize the logic inside a component into reusable isolated units. By mastering hooks, you can write more concise and easier to understand React components.

Remember, with great power comes great responsibility. While hooks make it easier to reuse stateful logic, they also require a good understanding of React's rendering behavior to use effectively. Happy coding!
