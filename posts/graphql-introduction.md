# Introduction to GraphQL

GraphQL is a query language for APIs that provides a more efficient, powerful and flexible alternative to traditional REST APIs.

## Key Concepts

1. Schema: Defines the structure of your data and available operations
2. Queries: Request specific data from the server
3. Mutations: Modify data on the server
4. Resolvers: Functions that resolve the data for each field

## Basic Query Example

```graphql
query {
  user(id: "123") {
    name
    email
    posts {
      title
    }
  }
}
